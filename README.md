async-maven-proxy
=================
Async Maven Proxy is a caching maven proxy which is written on top of Netty and is pretty light-weight.
I mainly wrote this because sonatype nexus and apache archiva did not work on my NAS to well and I was
in need for some more light-weight solution.

The code itself is written in Scala and uses Netty for the network code itself. Hope you find it
useful.

# How to run
First compile it

\# mvn clean compile assembly:single

Then copy the asyncmavenproxy.properties to your prefered directory and adjust if needed. After
this start the proxy via:

\# java -Dasyncmavenproxy.config=/path/to/config/asyncmavenproxy.properties -jar async-maven-proxy-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

Enjoy!
